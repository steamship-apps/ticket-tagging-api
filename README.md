# Ticket Tagging API

This app automatically assigns labels or tags to support-system tickets as they come in.  It assumes
your data will be held elsewhere, and the API provided will be used to tag the tickets as they come in.


## Smooth transition from zero-shot to trained classification

The app allows you to begin tagging tickets immediately with no training, leveraging zero-shot classification.  If you wish
to improve performance, you can provide examples of text and labels, and transition to using a likely higher-accuracy 
trained model. 

During the training and deployment of the trained model, the zero-shot model remains active and usable, as shown below:

## Using

### Parameters

- **save_classifications** - Whether to retain all classifications in the Steamship Space for caching or analysis purposes.

### Endpoints

- **set_labels** (List[labels]) - Set the labels that will be used for tagging. This can be a simple list of strings. Resetting the labels after training a model will reset to zero-shot classification.  For best results, clean labels of special characters like underscores.
- **tag_ticket**( ticket_text ) - Tag a ticket.  Returns confidences for all provided labels.  Throws an error if set_labels has not been called.  This method will work out of the box with a zero-shot classifier, and will seamlessly transition to a trained model after prerequisites are met below.
- **add_example** (ticket_text, list[labels]) - Add a curated example for learning.  This could happen after a user manually confirms or rejects ticket suggestions, or when importing an existing set of pre-tagged tickets.  One call per ticket, or we could provide a batch interface.
- **count_examples**() - Return both total count and count per tag of the examples that have been added so far.
- **start_specialize**() - When sufficient data has been loaded, call this to switch from zero-shot to trained classifiers for better performance.
- **specialize_status**() - Call this to know the current status of the app: unspecialized, specialization_in_progress, or specialized.  This method *must* be polled after specialization begins for the app to switch to specialized mode.
- **clear_examples**() - Remove all previously added examples
- **evaluate()** - [not yet implemented] Compare performance of labeled tickets to added examples, watch for drift over time
