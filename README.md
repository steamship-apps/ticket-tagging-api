# Question Answering Bot

This app demonstrates how to make a simple question answering service using Steamship.

## Initial Setup

We recommend using a python virtual environment for development. Just run the following to set it up:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

## Developing

The `api.py` file contains your Steamship app.
